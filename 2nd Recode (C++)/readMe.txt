This is still in progress. The code that is written is not finished and is not clear of syntax. The purpose here is to show what is accomplished as well as providing insight to the structure of the game
I've also included a "Dev notes" text file to showcase what I have planned for the future. There you can see what I find doable with my current skill sets as well as showcasing the care I put into the project. It shows how much I think about certain things and how each thing interacts. It shows that I want the player to have fun by incentivizing different playing styles. If you are looking at this project, reading the dev notes will help in understanding why the code is written like so.
