HP = lvl*6 + 4*vit + 2*str;
MP = (LVL + MAG)*3
DAMAGE = (LVL + ATK - DEF/4)*base dmg/15 * CRIT MOD/WEAKNESS MOD * 
Hit/Evade = [Skill Hit + (User Agi - Target Agi) + (User Luck - Enemy Luck)/5] * SUKUKAJA * SUKUNDA (note that base hit is very high for most skills)
Minimum Hit = Base Skill hit / 5
Critcal Chance = Base crit chance + (User luck - Target Luck)*3 + (User agi - target agi)/4 (0 if negative)
Aliment Chance = Base Aliment chance + (User luck - Target luck) + (User agi - Target Agi) (here aliment base rates are higher, won't work on bosses)
Healing: base heal * (lvl + mag)/15

STR- 

Random HIt chance: (this is a lot of steps) 
We take the difference of the min and max hits 
We do a 2^difference*10-2*agility points
Then we go down from the difference till 0 to do 2^x and add that from the previous value calculated. The final value will be the modular number (also biggest)
Conduct the RNGesus divided by the modular
The number of hits is determined by which range of numbers it falls between
Ex: 2-4 hits w/ 5 points agility--> 4-2 = 2 --> 2^2*10 =40, 40+2^1*10 = 60, 60+2^0*10= 70
rand()/70 = x --> if(x<agility (5)) reroll --> x+=agility (for now x is 34-->39).
Final x is 39 which is less than the 40 so 2 hits will be dished
You may notice initially the probabity was 4/7, 2/7, & 1/7 after doing the reductions and incretions it became, 30/65 (6-35), 20/65 (36-55), 15/65  

We can redesign the computation
Modular number = Max value for highest hitting = (2^(difference + 1) - 1)*10
For loop it down and stop after computing at x=0, save those values. We take the difference of the agility, user agi - target agi = agiDiff
x = rand()/modular if(x<agDiff) reroll -->x+=agiDiff --> check which range x belongs to, spit out number of hits



Experience need for next level = 5*lvl^(1.9) this gives us 100 less exp than we wanted but its close enough
Expgain = 5*enemy level/2

Battle (player)
Encounter Screen -> Choose attack/skill -> Choose target -> Checks for # of hits -> calculates what hits will land , if land -> damage formula return

Battle (ai)
Encounter rng -> random enemy +- 2 levels from player, 1-3 enemies -> calculate agility -> compare agility -> battle -> calculate turn order -> random skill or attack -> random target -> 

Roadmap for Random Encounter
    Which party goes first?
    First party is organized by fastest to slowest members
    Display the options
        Attack & Skill
            Choose & confirm target
            Spend resource
            Accuracy check
            Damage/heal/support check
            END OF MEMBER'S TURN
        Talk (friendly party only)

        Flee (friendly party only)
            chance of fleeing, if fail goes to enemy team
At any point the player can go back except when they confirm the target
