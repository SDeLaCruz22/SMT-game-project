1.
The world was struck with what is known as the Great Calamity, an event in which only the eldest have witnessed.
It was a time where the progress of civilization was reverted back to its barebones.
And though the cause of the Great Calamity remains unknown,from it came entitities of the supernatural who arose from the unknown- demons.
They have come upon mankind to claim this world as theirs.
However, factions within the demons were created and have been fighting a war amongst each other with mankind being caught in the crossfire.
Some factions chose not to participate in the conflict of inheriting the new world and took it upon themselves to guide humanity back in power.
These small pockets of humanity's remaining hope are scattered around the world, waiting for the oppurtunity to come back.

Voice from afar: ..ert...mons....uary | Feminine voice: ...st leave here..... | Distorted voice: ...ill the...iah... 
Feminine voice: see...xt life
Looming voice: Wandering human, identify yourself!
Looming voice: You are no longer what you were.
Looming voice: A new era is upon us 
Looming voice: The Goddess awaits your prescence, Hear her calls!
Goddess: %s. Call out my name! Make my destiny be entertwined with yours!, party[0]
Looming voice: Now awake yourself, and march towards your baptism to begin your new life!
You awake from the dream and find yourself in the middle of a barren wasteland.
The view is still as you remembered, a broken artifact of a past almost forgotten.
Despite not knowing where you are, you walk knowing what path to take.
A cave appears to you and you walk into it...\n\n\n
!

3. 
As you wandered inside the cave you find a sealed gate with flames hanging around it. As you approach you hear a loud bang that must have came from a gun, and you instinctively stop. You look around, but the shadows of the cave conceal any sort of visual presence 
Voice: STOP! Hands in the air! Any sudden movement, and you will be shot! 
Out of fear, you slowly raise your hands.
Voice: Show your blood! 
The town gaurd throws a small pick at your feet. You carefully pick it up and you slowly stab the palm of your hand, enough to show the blood spilling from it. You raise your arm to show the blood ooze down 
Voice: Clear!
From the corner of the cave, a man in metallic armor holding a rifle stalks away from the shadows. It's clear he must be guarding the gate
Guard: Where do you come from? 
You shrug, saying that you don't remember anything about yourself 
Guard: Hmmm.... What do you want?
You say that you were passing by, needing a place to rest and equip before moving on. 
He visually inspects you and stares at the comp tied to your arm.
Guard: Hey, is that a COMP? Where did you find such a thing? And you aren't even carrying a weapon with you. 
I donâ€™t know how you survived out there without being able to protect yourself, even with a COMP. Here, take this knife with you. I won't be needing it too much, I got this rifle after all. //too sudden
He knocks on the gate in a rhythmic manner, and the gate opens from the inside. 
Guard: Hey Kid! Before you go, what's your name? 
Guard: %s...I see. Go ahead %s, hope to see you alive next time., party[0], party[0] 
The gate closes behind you and you see the sanctuary in front of you. People carry on with their normal lives.

Stephen: If you haven't noticed already, the COMP allows you to learn abilities that a normal human could never be able to learn. 
Stephen: The COMP is actually making so that the user imitates a demon, which is also why you are able to talk to them and recruit them.
