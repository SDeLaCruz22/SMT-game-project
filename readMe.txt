The original code was my first real project with coding experience and it was the reason I decided to change my major to CSE. On its own the original code does compile, though any experienced programmer would know that it looks horrendous. But I think its good to keep it in. I was proud when I made it and I can use it to see how far my skills have come. 
The 2nd recode is a work in progress rework of the original code. More details in that folder
